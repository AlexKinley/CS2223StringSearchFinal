# CS2223StringSearchFinal
Eclipse project with an implementation of Horspool's Algorithm and some code to profile it.
It profiles based both on the amount of time it takes, and the number of character comparisons the algorithm does.
Also currently has an implementation of a simple string search algorithm for comparison (more can be added).
Main function reads in the moby dick text file and then searches for 1000 random strings from the file using both algorithms and then prints out the results in CSV format.
